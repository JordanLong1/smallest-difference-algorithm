sort both arrays in ascending order

smallest = infinity; 

left = 0 
right = 0 

if val of left pointer is less than val of right pointer? 

smallest = Math.abs(arrayOne[left] - arrayTwo[right])
left++

if val of right pointer is greater than val of left pointer?
smallest = Math.abs(arrayTwo[right] - arrayone[left])
right++

else case to make closest the closest val to 0..
